Introduction
Hi I am TS. I am currently a tech consultant and my side hustle is to build a security systems startup. 
I am looking to collaborate with any folks in this space
I used to be decent coder in grad school, but have been away from code for a bit. Therefore looking to definitely connect with anyone interested in a CTO role.
Going to bootstrap for now.
